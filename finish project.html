    <h1>BIOGRAPHY</h1>
    <ul type="s"> 
   <LI><h2>Early life and education</h2></LI> 
    <p>Ruit was born on September 4, 1954, to rural, illiterate parents, father Sonam Ruit and
        mother Kesang Ruit, in the remote mountainous village Olangchunggola in the border
         with Tibet in Taplejung district of northeast Nepal. His village of 200 people was 
    located 11,000 feet above the sea level on the lap of the world's third-highest peak,
     Mt. Kanchenjunga. It is one of the most remote regions of Nepal with no electricity, school, h
     ealth facilities or modern means of communication, and lies blanketed under snow for six to nine 
     months a year. Ruit's family made a subsistence living from small agriculture, petty trading and 
     livestock farming.</p>
     <p>Ruit was the second of his parents’ six children. He lost three siblings – an elder brother to diarrhea
         at age three. 3–4  and younger sister Chundak to fever at age eight. In many interviews, Ruit has mentioned
          that for him, the most painful was his younger sister Yangla's death. Yangla was his childhood companion, 
          and he was to develop a special bond with her over the years.She died at 15 of tuberculosis as the family was 
          too poor to afford treatment that could have saved her life. In many interviews, Ruit has said that this loss 
          made a strong mark on him and instilled in him a resolve to become a doctor and work for the poor who would not 
          otherwise have access to healthcare</p>
         <LI><h1>Early career and marriage</h1></LI>
          <P>While in Australia, Ruit gained further deep specialization in eye surgery. Ruit and Hollows created the Small
             Incision Cataract Surgery (SICS) which used intraocular lenses, and Ruit became the first Nepali doctor
              to use intraocular lenses.To gain donations to make eye surgeries more affordable and accessible in Nepal, 
              he established Nepal Eye Program Australia, later renamed The Fred Hollows Foundation. He was offered to stay 
              and work in Australia, but he returned to Nepal and continued to work in Tripureshwor eye hospital.</P>
